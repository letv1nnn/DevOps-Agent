# DevOps Agent

## Description
DevOps Agent with CI/CD Tasking (I thought it to be a MCP server and a client).
Modern delivery pipelines are increaseingly complex, invlolving tasks like environment provisioning, code linting, test orchestration, build artifact generation, and deployment rollouts. These tasks are often automated, but rarely orchestrated by sintelligent agents that understand context, adjust plans, or recover from failure. 

A ***DevOps Agent*** can fill this gap by triggering, monitoring and adapting CI/CD workflow based on plans and goals. The agent is able to invoke shell commands, interact with GitHub Actions or external CI tools, validate results and escalate issues based on configurable rules. It also has a full logging capability.

***Core Agent Responsibilities***

The DevOps agent's primary functions include:

- Executing predefined CI/CD stages (lint, test, build, deploy).
- Receiving tasks via command-line, REST, or LLM-generated plans.
- Running system-level tools securely (e.g., docker, cargo, gh).
- Logging all results and detecting failed or flaky tasks.
- Supporting rollback or retry for critical stages.

It can be extended to coordinate between multiple agent must handle. Each task is mapped to a command, arguments, and optional policy.
