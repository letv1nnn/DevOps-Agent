The output of the 'list_workflows' tool includes IDs, statuses, and conclusions for two completed workflows on GitHub, both with a conclusion of "success".

The log also shows that the agent downloaded logs for one workflow run (ID: 17413529778) using the 'download_workflows_logs' tool. No issues or errors were reported during this step either.

It appears that the execution of the pipeline was successful and all steps completed without any errors or warnings.
